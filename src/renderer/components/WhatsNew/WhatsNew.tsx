                There are tooltips to most buttons with shortcut keys displayed. The top menu only displays what is necessary and some new items have been added to it. <br />
                The brush and line colors are displayed as a thin line under the tool's button (Suggested by Pffft on the <a href={packageFile.discordInvite}>Discord Server</a>). The scrollbar has also been tweaked to look consistent with the theme.
